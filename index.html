        <pre>Hi all! I appreciate your patience in waiting and am happy to inform you that Monster Core (among many others) is now live! To help with this update (and other future ones) we've brought
on a new developer to help with the site maintenance, named Chris! He's already checked in some improvements to the remaster code (and other bits) with this update. He and the rest of the team have
worked hard on this update, with lots of chunky statblocks finding their homes onto the shelves (big thanks to everyone that worked on the data entry for that one). Full details are below - thanks 
again and enjoy the update!</pre>

Hello everyone! I think you've all waited long enough - I am very happy to present to you the newly Remastered Archives of Nethys!

The lengthier details are below, but before we get into those I wanted to give a quick summary of the changes, for those interested in jumping right in.
                
AoN can now be viewed in one of two modes - "Remastered" (the default) or "Legacy". To change your preference, simply open Shelyn's Corner (icon in the top-right of the site) and adjust the
setting there. Preferring "Remastered" content means you want to see the rules as presented in Player Core, GM Core, and the other upcoming Remastered products like Monster Core. Preferring 
"Legacy" content means you want to see the rules as presented in the Core Rulebook, Gamemastery Guide, Bestiary, etc. The site will react according to this preference, directing you to your 
preferred rules even if you search or access something from the other version.
                
There are more details on how this all works below, for those interested. Otherwise, I wanted to give a humongous shout out and thank you to everyone on the AoN team who's made this update 
possible. My own life has been more chaotic than I care to admit (which as a formerly True Neutral deity before the remaster, chaos does upset me) and the whole team has stepped up in a huge 
way to take on the challenges this update presented. Milan is responsible for the vast majority of development changes this required, enabling all of our different pages to react appropriately to the new
setting. Andreas has been engineering our search engine and tables to handle this same reactiveness, along with ensuring the previews properly reflect your choice. As always, Devin has been a 
monster at data entry, and these books required an absolute load beyond our usual month to month. The rest of the team (Jon, Jonny, Kao, Star, Tim) all pitched in and helped out wherever they 
could, whether it was finding bugs before release, adding hyperlinks, jumping in with data entry, or more.
                
This remaster has been a lot of work and change to support in the way we wanted, and I hope everyone that uses the site can enjoy the changes the team has put in. Again, thank you to everyone
on the AoN team - I hope all of you know how insurmountable this project would have been without each and everyone of you.
                
The rest of the details on the update are below - thank you again to the team, to all of our fans for their patience in waiting, and to Paizo for continuing to develop a system worth supporting this 
way. Please enjoy the newly remastered Archives of Nethys!
